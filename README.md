## Overview

Album is a photo album editing program that allows users to rotate, and caption their pictures and writes the output to an html file

## How to run

Compile the program by typing "make" in a terminal window, in the CS-58-project1 directory. Run the program by typing album <YOUR FIRST PICTURE.jpg> <YOUR SECOND PICTURE.jpg> ... <YOUR LAST PICTURE.jpg>. All pictures must be .jpg and must be located in the CS-58-project1 directory. The program will display a thumbnail for each picture, and will prompt the user for a caption and a rotation (y/n and l/r for yes or no and left or right).
